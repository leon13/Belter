> An exceptional or outstanding example of something.

__Harry Harrison's Belter, A full suite framework to help you hit the ground running.__

This boilplate isn't really meant for general use, but more for those who know what they're doing. Or at least like to think they do... _I'm talking about you, Phil_.

## Features
Aside from the obvious starting point that can always take so damn long, Belter includes a few little neat tricks I've picked up along the way.

- Fully responsive or just partly. Whatever you fancy.
- Completely OS independent.
- Reltively easy to learn.
- Third-Party framework friendly.
- Compiling and dependencies handled thanks to [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
- Icons handled thanks to [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).

## Purpose
The web is becoming incredibly saturated with hundereds of CSS Frameworks that come with Javascript helpers and so much junk. If you're a half decent developer you'd be amazed at how much get's left in live sites. Or maybe you wouldn't. Maybe you're guilty of including all of Bootstrap's javascript just because the client mentioned they'd like an accordian on a page once and changed their mind after they realised it's not a musical instrument.

Well, Belter aims to give you a starting point for your sites but also to help keep your workflow on track. For many this'll mean revamping your workflow, but I'm reletively confident this'll be a good thing once you really get into using Belter. There's an extra advantage here in that it's completely OS independent, so working in mixed-OS teams is no longer an issue.

## Installation
I promise i'll write these up soon.

## Editions
I'm going to do my best to compile the Belter Framework into the following systems. Each of these will be seperate, and linked from here when they're available. If you have any suggestions, please get in touch.

- PHP
- Statamic
- Expression Engine
- Craft
- Hammer
- Wordpress

## Requirements
Each edition of Belter has it's own requirments (Obviously), so you'll need to check those out between the branches for each of them. Otherwise, the requirements are pretty standard...

- A basic knowledge of PHP. We're talking really basic.
- A presumed understanding of how to actually make a website.
- Some SASS/SCSS knowledge.
- Some Javascript knowledge.
- A little Node knowledge and both Node & NPM installed and up to date.
- SASS installed through Ruby.

## License
The Stalactite Framework is obviously not for everyone, but the license is the MIT standard as follows...
